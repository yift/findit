# HasPrefix string method

The `hasPrefix` (or `startsWith`, or `has_prefix` or `start_with`)  method is used to check if a string starts with another string.
It accept a single argument which is the substring to check for.

For example:

```bash
findit -w 'stem.hasPrefix("fact")'
```

will show the files with name that start with the word "fact".
