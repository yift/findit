# IndexOf string method

The `indexOf` (or `index_of`)  method is used to check the location of a string within a string.
It accept a single argument which is the substring to check for.

If the sub string is not contains within the string the result will be empty.

For example:

```bash
findit -w 'name.indexOf("fact") = 0'
```

will show the files with name that start with the word "fact".
