# Split string method
The `split`  method is used to convert a string to a list of strings using a separator.

It takes an  optional single string argument which is the separator between the items within the string.

For example:
```bash
findit -d 'name: `name`, path: `path.split("/")`'
```
will show all the files and their path parts.
