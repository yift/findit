# Minus (`-`) numeric operator

The Minus (`-`) numeric operator is used to subtract two numbers.
Note that is the left operand smaller than the right operand the result will be empty (as negative numbers are unsupported).

For example:

```bash
findit -w 'size - 1024 > 2048'
```

Will filter all the files with size subtract 1024 is bigger than 2048.
